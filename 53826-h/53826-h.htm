  <h2 class='c003'><b>I</b></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_4 c004'>IN the doorway of an old tenement-house, far
down in the slums of New York, two women
were standing, their heads close together as they
gossiped about the passers-by.</p>

<p class='c005'>A young girl—she might have been thirteen—tripped
along the sidewalk, kicking her legs out in
front of her as she went, so that she could see her
stockings.</p>

<p class='c005'>Her odd movements caught the women’s eyes,
and they asked each other what could be the cause
of them.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I never see her act like that before. Puttin’
on such airs! Dear! dear! Saw ye ever the likes
of it?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, see her new stockings!” said the younger
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>woman. “What mighty fine ones! Did you
ever?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I doubt she came by them in no good way,”
said the other. “Janet, young un! See here!”</p>

<p class='c005'>The child stopped, holding up her tattered gown
to show her pretty stockings. “Who give you
<i>them</i>?” cried the woman who had called her.</p>

<p class='c005'>The girl replied quietly, “’Twas the Bishop
give me ’em.”</p>

<p class='c005'>At this the women exclaimed in chorus, “The
Bishop! That’s a fine tale! How’d you know it
was the Bishop?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Janet said Roy, the newsboy, told her; and the
women asked her, “How is it your father hasn’t
got hold of ’em? He’d sell ’em for drink inside
of a minute.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, I only wears ’em on the street,” said
Janet, “and I takes ’em off an’ hides ’em before
I go home.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The women begged her to tell them all about it,
and settled themselves comfortably to hear the
story.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>The girl’s tale ran thus: one day a lot of children
were dancing on the sidewalk to the tune of
an old organ-grinder, and she began dancing with
them. Roy then came by with his newspapers,
and, putting them down on a step, seized her
round the waist and whirled her off among the little
children. He stopped suddenly, for a gentleman
who was passing wanted a paper. The girl was
overheated with her dancing, and began to fan
herself with one of Roy’s papers; Roy said afterwards
her eyes were as bright as stars.</p>

<p class='c005'>The gentleman asked her name, and where she
lived; and when she told him, he said, “Janet, if
you will come to yonder church,” pointing to the
steeple, “at seven o’clock on Christmas night, I
will give you something to take home with you.”
Then he paid Roy for the paper, and gave the
change to Janet, saying with a smile, “This will
buy some refreshments for the ball.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Thank you, sir,” she said. “I am very
hungry. I have had nothing to eat since yesterday
noon.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>At this the gentleman didn’t smile any more,
but looked sad. “Why did you dance, then?”
he said.</p>

<p class='c005'>Roy spoke before she had a chance to answer:
“Sir, Janet was hungry and cold, and that was the
best way to get warm.” The gentleman walked
away, and she could see him rub the back of his
hand across his eyes. She asked Roy what his
name was, and he said he didn’t know, but it was
the Bishop.</p>

<p class='c005'>She bought something to eat with the money,
and divided it with Roy, and he ran off to sell his
papers. The organ-grinder went on his way, and
the children stopped dancing.</p>

<p class='c005'>So on Christmas night, Janet went early to the
big church, as the Bishop had told her to do.
When she got inside the door, she stood still with
wonder, for there was a great tree, as big as an
out-door tree, all lighted with little candles from
the floor to the top, and all over it were hanging
sparkling toys. And when she came near to it,
she saw the Bishop standing by it.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>She did not think he would know her again, but
he smiled and said, “Janet, I was expecting you.”
And then he took a stick with a hook on the end
of it, and, reaching over the heads of some fine
ladies who were arranging things at the foot of the
tree, he took the stockings down and put them in
her hands. Then he put his white hands on her
head, and said, “God bless you, my child! Remember,
keep yourself pure and clean to your life’s
end.” Each stocking had a silver dollar in the
toe, and was filled with candy, and tied around
the top with a blue ribbon to keep the candy in.</p>

<p class='c005'>“See!” said Janet, as she told the story, “I tie
the ribbon on each leg to keep me from getting
out.” She lifted the ragged gown to show the ribbon
garters. She said she skipped out of the great
big church, hugging the stockings close to her and
covering them with a bit of her shawl to hide her
treasure from the people she passed.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Don’t you know such a fine bishop’s name?”
asked one of the women.</p>

<p class='c005'>“No,” said the child, “but Roy said he was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>the good Bishop who stays down here with us, and
don’t go away frolicking. And now I must go to see
Roy. There he is calling his extras at the corner.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well, I never!” said one of the women, as the
child skipped away. “She seems to make friends,
don’t she? She and that boy are awful fond of
each other; and now there ’s this Bishop!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well,” said the other, “Janet is a pretty girl,
with her dark eyes, and her hair always braided in
one long plait down her back—and even if she is
in rags, her hair is always tidy.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Her father sells everything that people give
her—it ’s a wonder he don’t cut off her hair and
sell that. Well, the girl has a white skin, and a
pretty mouth, and a straight nose just like her
mother’s. She don’t look and she don’t act like
as if she was born and raised here among us poor
folks.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“That she don’t; and she ’s such a little mite
for her age, with those little hands and feet. You
wouldn’t take her to be fourteen, would you,
now?”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>While the women were talking her over, Janet
went to find Roy, who stood at the corner shivering
with the cold, with his papers under his arm.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Hello, Roy!” said she,  “see my beautiful
stockings! That Bishop gave ’em to me off the
tree, and they was full of candy and money!”
Coming close to him, she said in a whisper,
“Here ’s some for you!” and she took a little
paper bag full of candy from under her ragged
shawl where she had hidden it.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, Roy,” she said,  “it was the finest tree
you ever did see! And the Bishop gave me the
stockings his own self, and when he gave them to
me he put his hands on my head, and what do
you think he said? He said, ‘God bless you, my
child! Remember to keep yourself pure and clean
to the end of your life.’ And when he was a-saying
it, he looked up at a sugar boy with shiny
wings that was hanging on the top of the tree.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The boy and girl parted at the corner, he to sell
his papers through the cold and the mire of the
slums, and she to go to her poor, wretched home.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>She mounted the rickety stairs of an old tenement-house,
up to the top floor, where, in one
small garret, the whole family lived. In one
corner of the room was an old ragged straw mattress,
on which the father, mother, and baby slept.
The baby was asleep now, the father was drinking
in a saloon near by. In another corner was a pile
of straw where Janet and her sister Bessie slept;
and in yet another, on a heap of rags and paper,
lay two pretty little boys, sound asleep, unconscious
of the fact that they were cold and hungry.
One could see, in spite of rags and dirt, that they
were like cherubs, with their sunny curls.</p>

<p class='c005'>The poor mother sat by the feeble light of a
candle, the wick burned nearly down to the bottle
which served for a candlestick. She was sewing
on a coarse garment that she wanted to finish, in
order to buy bread for the children with the few
pennies she would get for it.</p>

<p class='c005'>All that any of them had eaten that day was
some candy that Janet had slyly put in their
mouths, not letting them know where she kept it.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>Janet went to her mother, the poor, tired, sick
woman, and, bidding her open her mouth, she fed
her with sweet chocolate and brought her a drink
of water.</p>

<p class='c005'>Then she sat down by the suffering woman, and
hugged her poor cold feet to her heart, trying to
warm them. In a low voice, so as not to waken
the sleeping children, she gave her mother a description
of the beautiful tree, and how the Bishop
had given her the stockings himself.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I take them off and hide them when I get
home,” she said, “so father will not sell them;
and the candy I hid last night under my pile of
straw—that’s how I had these good chocolates for
you now.”</p>

<p class='c005'>And then she repeated again to her mother the
words of the good Bishop, “Remember, keep
yourself pure and clean to the end of your life.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The mother swallowed hard, as though her
throat hurt her, and she became deadly pale.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, mother!” said the child, “the Bishop
has made me feel so happy—and even this old
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>garret looks better than it did, because I am so
happy.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The mother said: “I feel peaceful and happy
too while I listen to you. You make my thoughts
go back to when I was a little girl. I remember a
hymn I used to sing in Sunday-school.” And in
a broken way, gasping for breath, she repeated the
last two lines:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c002'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Cover my—defenceless head</div>
      <div class='line in4'>With the shadow—of—Thy wing.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>She leaned back, raising her eyes, as though she
could see the angels looking down upon her,
though to the outward eye only the rough, weather-stained
rafters were above her.</p>

<p class='c005'>Janet fell asleep at her mother’s feet. The
woman’s head fell forward on the unfinished work.
The candle burned down, and the fallen wick
spluttered in the grease.</p>

<p class='c005'>Heavy steps ascended the stairs. An unsteady
hand opened the door; and a large man fell heavily
to the floor. It was the drunken father, returning
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>from the saloon.... The gray streaks of
early dawn came into the dingy garret, and revealed
the face of the dead man.</p>

<p class='c005'>A few hours later the body was removed. The
two dollars the Bishop had given Janet was paid
out for back rent, so the poor woman and her children
were allowed to stay in the wretched room a
little longer. Janet took her mother’s work back
to the shop, which was some distance away. She
trudged through the snow, cold, wet, and hungry.</p>

<p class='c005'>When she returned late in the afternoon, climbed
the rickety stairs, and entered the room, she stood
speechless in the middle of the floor.</p>

<p class='c005'>The sun was shining through the broken panes
of the one window in the garret, and its rays fell
like a shower of gold all over the child as she stood
there, crowning her head as with a halo. But she
heeded not its beauty. She stood there, struck
dumb with astonishment.</p>

<p class='c005'>There was absolutely nothing and no one in the
room but herself! Father, mother, children, mattress,
straw—all gone—the room utterly empty!</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>She knew not how long she had stood there,
speechless in her misery, when she heard steps ascending
the stairs. Some one fumbled in the dark
hall for the latch, and finally opened the door.
Two burly men entered, and asked Janet who she
was. From them she learned that the people who
had lived there were gone, that they had the room
to rent, and would take the key at six o’clock, by
which time she must be gone.</p>

<p class='c005'>When they went out, she did not move from the
sunshine. A child of the slums, she was used to
rough men and women, and was not afraid of
them. But she was stunned with this new trouble—with
her absolute loneliness. Where were her
people? What did it all mean? Where should
she go to find them?</p>

<p class='c005'>Light steps came swiftly up the stairs, and after
a gentle knock the door was opened. It was Roy
who stepped into the spot of fading sunshine beside
her.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, Janet!” said he.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, Roy!” was all she could answer.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>And the boy and girl stood crowned with the
golden halo, in absolute silence.</p>

<p class='c005'>At last, as the sun’s rays were passing away, Roy
spoke:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Janet, they’re all gone! Taken away while
you went with the work. Janet, the baby was
dead in the night.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The child said but one word, “Froze?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“No,” said Roy, “it was the dipthery. And
your mother had it, too. Somebody told on ’em,
an’ so the Board of Health sent in a jiffy, an’ a
great black ambulance came an’ took her an’ all
the children, and then some men came and took
everything out and burned it all, and did something
to the room. I came and looked at them
awhile, but they sent me away. I see the ambulance
drive off. I was close to it.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Where?” Janet gasped.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I don’t know,” said the boy.</p>

<p class='c005'>Again there was silence. The children of the
slums, born in poverty, sorrow, and disgrace, do
not cry. Life is too stern a reality.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>Then Roy spoke in a whisper, as if in his untutored
mind he felt that in the presence of such
sorrow a loud word would be a sacrilege—“Janet!”</p>

<p class='c005'>She turned and looked him in the face. He
was pale and trembling, and the words came painfully,
as if he feared to hurt her any more.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Janet—when they took your mother out of
here, she was dead. I seed her face. I didn’t
say nothin’, but I know she was dead, and I come
now to tell you. But I wish I hadn’t—you look
so white and scared.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The only sound was a choking gasp from the
poor child.</p>

<p class='c005'>Roy took her hand in his. “Janet, I love you!
Don’t look so white! It scares me. If anything
happened to you it would kill me. You’re all
I’ve got in the world. Don’t look so—I can’t
stand it. I’ll take care of you. I earn a good
bit of money some days. I’ll work hard, and
then when we are older——”</p>

<p class='c005'>“What?” said the girl simply.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>“Why, then we’ll get the good Bishop to marry
us. There now, Janet, be a good girl and come
away, before the men come back, for I saw them
goin’ out in the street, an’ if they catch us here
when they come for the key, they’ll say we have
it too, and they’ll take us away in that ugly black
ambulance.”</p>

<p class='c005'>So she let him lead her out of that garret so full
of memories, down the dark rickety stairs, into
the cold street. They were homeless, friendless
orphans, starting out on life’s stormy sea, hungry,
cold, forsaken.</p>

<p class='c005'>They walked hand in hand until they were
several blocks away, in another part of the slums,
where Janet had never been. Then, standing in
the shelter of a doorway, they looked at each other
for some time in silence. At last Roy spoke:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Janet, dear—I don’t know where to take
you.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Where do you go, Roy, at night?” said she.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, anywheres! Sometimes us boys sleeps in
boxes, and sometimes they have straw in ’em, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>more times not. But you see, Janet, that won’t
do for the likes of you.”</p>

<p class='c005'>He thought in silence for a moment. “Let me
see,” he said. “I’ve got ten cents in my pocket.
That ought to lodge you for one night—but where?
Oh, I know! Now, Janet, listen to me, and do
just what I tell you. I’m going to take you to an
old apple-woman near here, and don’t you open
your mouth about the dipthery, and don’t say
nothin’ ’bout where you lived or that you had any
people, nor nothin’, ’cause if you do nobody ’ll let
us come near ’em; and I’ll do what I can with
the cross old apple-woman. She sort o’ takes to
me, an’ she gives me specked apples for runnin’
errands for her.”</p>

<p class='c005'>So they went on until they came to the apple-stand,
over which a torch was burning.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Aunt Betsy,” said Roy, “here ’s a poor little
girl that can’t be left out on the street to freeze.
Won’t you let the kid sleep on your floor for
to-night?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Now, Roy,” said the old woman, “you know
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>you’ve picked up a good-for-nothing vagabone
on the street. Why don’t you take her to the
’ciety?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Lawks, Aunt Betsy, I don’t know nothin’
’bout ’cieties, an’ fore we could find one she’d
be froze stiff, so if you won’t take her in, she’ll
have to lie down any place and die. I’ve got ten
cents in my pocket, and I’ll give it to you if
you’ll keep the kid to-night.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, you’ve got ten cents, have you? Well,
all right, she can sleep on a bit of a mat on my
floor. And where might you be goin’?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well,” said he, “I’ve got to sell some extrys
late to-night, and I’ll scare up a box to turn in
somewheres. Say,” he added, “she’s awful
hungry. If you’ll give her a bit of grub, I’ll pay
you for it to-morrow when I come round, and give
you a paper.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“All right, Roy, I’ll do what I kin.”</p>

<p class='c005'>So Janet was settled for the night. It is true
she had to sleep on the floor and put up with some
scraps to eat. But things go by comparison in this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>world, and to poor, cold, starving Janet it seemed
like living in a palace. Tired and worn out, she
slept soundly, forgetting all her sorrows.</p>

<p class='c005'>At last the sun rose in the glory of a new day,
making the icicles sparkle in its light, and decking
vines, bushes, and trees with a covering of diamonds.
Dame Nature in all her glory of sparkling
jewels smiled at the ladies of the world, wearing
their paltry gems, as they drove to the slums to
leave some little dolls, and wooden horses, and tin
watches that wouldn’t go, for starving, ragged,
weary children. Dame Nature longed to teach
them if they would learn of her; for, besides her
beauty, she was very wise in all things. But they
thought they knew, and turned a deaf ear to all
her teachings.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>
  <h2 class='c003'><b>II</b></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_4 c004'>WHEN Janet opened her eyes, she rubbed
them hard to collect her scattered senses.
After a few minutes everything came back to her,
and with a heart full of sorrow she realized her
desolation. Mother, brothers, sisters, all she
loved—gone! Even the drunken father did not
seem so bad, now she had no one to love her.
Yes, there was Roy! And then her heart seemed
filled to overflowing with love and gratitude to
him.</p>

<p class='c005'>She got up and asked the apple-woman if she
had any chores for her to do. The old woman
gave her some apples to shine and pile, with the
red side up, to tempt the customers as they passed
by. After this was done, she gave her one of
them, and a piece of bread.</p>

<p class='c005'>About noon Roy came along, with three cents
and a paper. Then Janet remembered the thirty
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>cents she had been paid for her mother’s sewing;
she had been too full of other things to think of it
before. Roy invested them in matches and pins,
and started her out to sell them on the street. He
thought they would be doing well if, between
them, they could make enough to keep body and
soul together and find some shelter at night.</p>

<p class='c005'>Janet could make no plans. She only knew
enough to do as Roy told her. A child of the
slums, she had never been inside of any house but
the most wretched tenement. She was ignorant of
the names and use of the simplest things; so it
was impossible to find a place of service for her.
All she had ever seen were the windows of forlorn
second-hand clothing stores, pawnshops, saloons,
and factories. Roy’s sale of papers took him into
a wider field, so that he knew a little more about
civilized life.</p>

<p class='c005'>The old apple-woman had a mongrel dog that
she had raised. He helped to guard her stand,
and was a very sagacious animal. Janet and the
dog became fast friends, and he would leave the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>stand and follow her on her rounds. This did not
please old Aunt Betsy, so she tied him to the
stand. Janet and the dog, however, still continued
the best of friends.</p>

<p class='c005'>The morning that Janet had gone with her
mother’s work, she had dressed herself in a short
skirt of her mother’s and an old straw hat with a
bit of black ribbon round the crown, while over
her shoulders was a coarse woollen shawl. These
garments were patched and mended, but they were
better than the rags the poor child wore when we
first saw her, dancing on the pavement.</p>

<p class='c005'>The winter passed away, and the blessed summer,
which is so much easier for the poor, came in
its turn. Then Janet could sleep out-of-doors under
some shed.</p>

<p class='c005'>But the summer, too, went on its way; and now
October was here, with its chilly, windy nights;
and the poor child was forced to appeal to the old
apple-woman again. She consented to let her stay
for five cents a night, provided she would bring
enough sticks for the fire, and shine the apples,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>and scrub the floor. When this was done, the
child, often very weary, would start out to sell her
wares. Her appearance was so pitiful and appealing
that although she only tried to sell to those
who were nearly as poor as herself, she generally
made at least enough to pay Aunt Betsy her five
cents and get herself some food.</p>

<p class='c005'>Roy was now employed by a regular newsdealer,
so he made somewhat more. But their clothes
were now very ragged, and Janet’s feet were
nearly bare.</p>

<p class='c005'>A few days after the Christmas when Janet got
the stockings, the good Bishop was called out of
town. Not forgetting the poor little waif he had
befriended, he gave special instructions to some of
his fellow-workers to investigate the case, and if it
was found worthy, to minister to the wants of the
family. They endeavored to carry out his instructions,
but found the miserable garret occupied by
strangers who knew nothing of little Janet or her
family. When they inquired of the neighbors,
they were told that the whole family had died of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>diphtheria, and everything that was in the room
had been destroyed. Believing this report, of
course they made no further effort to find poor
little Janet. It seemed as if a network of misery
had enveloped her, as if every avenue of relief had
been blocked up.</p>

<p class='c005'>But she still had Roy, and he had Janet, and
each kept hope alive in the heart of the other. It
was hope on which the two children lived day by
day. It gave them sweet dreams at night, and
with its beacon-light before them they were even
happy in the midst of their miserable surroundings.</p>

<p class='c005'>One day in October, Janet was trying to sell her
wares along the Bowery; Roy was calling some
extras on the other side, a little farther up the
street.</p>

<p class='c005'>Suddenly Janet missed the shrill voice, and
looking to see what had become of him, she saw a
crowd collecting about the spot where only a few
minutes before she had seen Roy.</p>

<p class='c005'>In an agony of dread, she hurried over, and,
pushing her way through the crowd, followed the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>men who were carrying something into a drugstore.
There she found poor Roy, stretched out,
bleeding, on the floor. In crossing the street, he
had been knocked down by a heavy wagon, and
the wheel had crushed him.</p>

<p class='c005'>With a cry of pain, she pushed her way to him
and knelt down by his side. He opened his eyes
when he heard her voice. They met hers in one
long gaze. Their hands clasped; his lips moved.
Bending over him, she heard him whisper, “Good-by,
Janet!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Roy was gone from her, and she was left alone.</p>

<p class='c005'>She felt a warm breath on the hand that still
held Roy’s, and, looking down, she saw the mongrel
dog, who had broken away from the apple-stand
and followed her. He licked her hand, and
her tears fell on his head. As she put her arms
round him, she felt that he was now her only
friend.</p>

<p class='c005'>The men who carried poor Roy away pushed
her roughly aside, and in a bewildered way she
followed the dog, who seemed trying to lead her to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>the apple-woman. When Aunt Betsy saw the dog,
she gave Janet an apple for bringing him back.
But Janet could not eat it, though she had had
nothing all day.</p>

<p class='c005'>She tried to tell the woman about Roy, but the
words would not come. Death, to Janet, meant
only the agony of separation. An hour ago, she
had Roy with her—and now he was not with her.
This was all there was in it to the poor child—nothing
beyond, no hope of meeting again. Is it
to be wondered at? Uneducated, she knew
nothing but her toiling daily life. She had never
been in a church but that one Christmas night,
and so had learned nothing through that channel
of a life beyond. When Roy’s dying lips murmured
“Good-by, Janet!” it was forever. No
home, no books, no intelligence in her life, she
was but little above the plane of her only friend,
the dog.</p>

<p class='c005'>To others, death is but the change from darkness
to light. But to Janet and to the dog it
meant the end. She was only so much above the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>dumb brute that she could look into life a little
farther, and so could suffer more.</p>

<p class='c005'>A newsboy came along and told the apple-woman
the tale Janet was unable to tell. She was shocked
for the moment, for she had in her rough way liked
Roy. But the hard, business part of her nature
was uppermost in a little while. Here she was
with this child on her hands. When Janet could
sell nothing, as was often the case, Roy generally
had a few cents to give her, so she had always felt
that she was sure of some little pay for the poor
shelter she gave the child. But now the case was
different, and so she told Janet in no gentle
way:</p>

<p class='c005'>“You must get away from here.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Where?” asked Janet in a bewildered tone.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, I don’t know. Go to some of the s’cieties,
or to that Bishop as gave you them old ragged
stockings you think so much of.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I can’t,” said the girl, despairingly. “I
don’t know where to find him.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well,” said the woman, “you can stay here
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>to-night, and I’ll give you a bit to eat in the
morning before you go.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Janet cried all night for her companion, for she
knew that in the morning she would not hear his
voice calling the papers. Roy was gone from her—had
he not said “Good-by” to her? The dog
slept beside her on the floor, and tried in every
way he knew to comfort her, as he felt her tears
fall upon his head. While the old woman slept,
he stole to the box and brought Janet an apple in
his mouth. Somehow his kindness comforted her;
she dried her tears and kissed his shaggy head.
For his sake she ate the apple and tried, but in
vain, to sleep.</p>

<p class='c005'>Morning at length dawned, and Janet rose, her
plans all made. She did the work for the old
woman, ate the dry bread and drank the weak
coffee that was given her, and, after tying the dog,
went forth again into the cold, hard world. The
dog whined so piteously when Janet kissed him,
and gave her such a pleading look which she could
not misunderstand, that it was impossible to resist
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>it. She left him tied, but in such a way that if he
tried he could wriggle himself loose. She bade
the old woman good-by, and thanked her for the
shelter she had given her.</p>

<p class='c005'>Roy had told her once that there was a beautiful
park somewhere in the city, but it was a great
way off. He told her there was lovely green grass
in the park, and big, shady trees, and quiet pools
of water; that the birds sang there all day long,
and beautiful flowers bloomed there until almost
winter-time. So the heart of the lonely waif, deserted
and cast out by all mankind, turned to this
beautiful spot of nature. She gathered her rags
about her and started to walk to the park. She
was not strong—starvation and exposure do not
give strength to children—and when hope dies,
the cup of sorrow runs over, and the little strength
left is soon exhausted.</p>

<p class='c005'>So she trudged along, sometimes stopping for a
moment to look at what she passed, and often
gazing at the food displayed in the shop-windows,
for she was very hungry. Something in her wan,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>white face must have appealed to a man who
passed her, for he stopped and gave her a penny.
She bought a roll with it, devoured it like an
animal, not like a child, and then walked on.</p>

<p class='c005'>At last a lady passed her and asked her to
carry one of the many bundles she was laden with
a few blocks for her. Janet rose to oblige her, for
she was sitting on the steps of a house to rest.
When she had carried the bundle as far as was desired,
the woman gave her five cents, and, noticing
how utterly miserable the child looked, asked her
where she was going.</p>

<p class='c005'>“To the park,” replied Janet.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Why, my child,” she said, “that is very far
away from here. You had better ride in the
cars.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But I don’t know how to get the right one,”
said Janet.</p>

<p class='c005'>The woman showed her the car, and with the
five cents she rode and rested at the same time.</p>

<p class='c005'>At last she came to what she knew must be the
beautiful park. After she had entered it, she went
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>along in a timid, fearful way till at last she came
to a secluded spot. She seated herself on one of
the benches, but from time to time she looked over
her shoulder to see if the policeman (the greatest
terror of the poor) was coming.</p>

<p class='c005'>She rested a long time under the overhanging
branches of a large tree—how long she did not
know. After a while she saw throngs of people
on the road, driving in gay carriages. She wondered
if she could cross over to the water, where
Roy had told her there were boats; but she was
afraid to move, for fear the police would lay hold
of such a ragged-looking thing as she felt herself
to be.</p>

<p class='c005'>On this beautiful October afternoon the grass,
lately mowed, looked like an emerald carpet
spread down. The sunbeams and the shadows
chased each other across it, as the leaves of the
trees stirred in the gentle breeze. Now and then
some dry, crisp leaves fell around Janet, for there
had been a frost already in the early autumn.</p>

<p class='c005'>Little Janet was very hungry, and the look of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>starvation in her young eyes was enough to melt a
heart of stone. She kept her feet carefully on the
path, for fear of touching the grass, for all around
she saw the signs, “Keep off the grass,” and she
was afraid of trespassing.</p>

<p class='c005'>At last a thought struck her. She could make
herself look a little better! Putting her hand in
her bosom, she pulled out the stockings the Bishop
had given her. Taking off her ragged, rusty
shoes, she carefully drew them on.</p>

<p class='c005'>They were very different now from what they
were when the Bishop took them off the tree and
handed them to her. In each one there was a
hole in the toe and a hole in the heel, and a number
of other smaller holes all the way up, until they
all joined at the top to make a ragged edge. It
was not easy to get the torn stockings on, but she
pulled them up tight, and tied a bit of string
around them to keep them in place. Then she
pulled them about so as to show the fewest holes,
and dexterously drew the old shoes over them.
She patted the stockings lovingly, as her thoughts
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>went back to that Christmas and the tree in the
church, saying softly to herself: “And the Bishop
said to me, ‘God bless you, my child! Remember
to keep yourself clean and pure to the end of your
life.’ And he looked up at that sugar boy with
the shining wings on the top of the tree. Now I
wonder who that was, and what he meant when he
said, ‘God bless you, my child’? Who is God?
‘Remember to keep yourself clean to the end of
your life.’ I’m ragged, but I guess I’m clean.
And pure, he said, too. I wonder what ‘pure’
means? I can’t make it all out. I do wish grand
people would say words poor, ragged little girls
like me could make out; but I suppose the Bishop
couldn’t do that. And I’ll never know what he
wanted me to do. Well! I’ll try to find them
boats Roy told me about.”</p>

<p class='c005'>She looked carefully around, and, watching her
chance when the policeman’s back was turned
towards her, she passed behind him across the
walk, and then sped away to the water’s edge, still
hiding behind trees and bushes.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>When she got to the water, she was struck dumb
with the beautiful scenes around her. On the top
of the bank, on the drive, walked another policeman.
She skipped behind a tree at the edge of
the water. Then she saw ducks, swans, and
geese, swimming right up to the land. She saw
troops of children of all ages, children of the rich,
beautiful, with plump cheeks and curly hair, and
such lovely clothes. She saw little tots, with bonnets
almost as large as themselves. They were
joyous and happy, laughing and talking as they
fed the feathered tribe. To Janet’s horror, these
favored children pulled grass by the handfuls, and
fed the waterfowl, while the policemen talked to
the nurses on the drive. Little Janet always had
before her eyes the sign, “Keep off the grass.”</p>

<p class='c005'>A pretty child dropped a biscuit on the ground.
Janet’s hungry eyes were fixed upon it, but she
dared not touch it, for fear of the dreaded policeman.
The lovely child looked up and caught the
glance; and, like children in their fraternal, natural
way, she said, “Do you want it, little girl?”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>Janet nodded, and the child picked it up and gave
it to her, to feed the swans with.</p>

<p class='c005'>Just then the nurse looked up from her novel
and saw the child talking and handing something
to this ragged little creature. She screamed, with
horror in her voice, “Susie! Come here this instant!
What are you doing with that ragged vagrant?”
And to Janet: “Be off with you! I’ll
tell the policeman to take you away. Such vagabonds
as you are not allowed in the park!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Janet moved off with a full heart, wondering
why she had not good clothes and pretty curls like
those children, and why the nurses and every one
drove her away from them. She was too weary
and bewildered to think any more. She was near
the boat-house, so, sitting down on the steps, she
ate her biscuit, and dipped up water in her hand
and drank it to quench her thirst. At the top of
the bank she saw more policemen, but they were
interested in more important things; so she passed
on by the edge of the water until she came to a
hill densely covered with trees and bushes. She
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>turned away from the drive and climbed the
hill.</p>

<p class='c005'>When she got to the top, she sat down on the
ground and took off her stockings because the
twigs caught in the holes and tripped her. She
took one off slowly, and dropped it on the walk in
a little heap, and then its mate in another little
heap.</p>

<p class='c005'>She was so exhausted that she crawled under a
bush whose branches bent over and touched the
ground. There, completely hidden, she felt safe.
No people passing, no policemen, no one to call
her ragged. This seemed a forsaken and lonely
spot, apparently not worth guarding. So she soon
fell asleep and forgot all her woes.</p>

<p class='c005'>She slept for hours, and woke with a chill, wondering
where she could be. It was some time
before she could remember and tell how she got
there. Then memory asserted itself, and all her
misery rushed back upon her.</p>

<p class='c005'>She sat up and crept out of her hiding-place,
feeling that she was alone in the world. No
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>father, mother, sisters, or brothers, no Roy, no
one in the wide, wide world.</p>

<p class='c005'>Not only no one to love her, but no one even to
know that she existed. Alone—all alone!</p>

<p class='c005'>The throngs of people had left the park and
gone to their homes, to eat, drink, and be merry.
Little children were tucked snugly in their beds,
and all the great city was at its ease. Janet was
alone in the silence of the night. No sound was
heard in the darkness. The night was cloudy,
and she was cold, hungry, and miserable.</p>

<p class='c005'>Her brain was weak from starvation, and she
said in a whisper: “Yes, Bishop, I’ve kept myself
clean and pure. Your stockings are here,
Bishop. There’s a hole in the toe, a hole in the
heel, and holes all between the toe and the heel—but
I’ve got them yet.”</p>

<p class='c005'>She put on the old shoes, and seemed to be
looking for something. Her braided hair had
come loose, and fell like a veil about her. Her
eyes were raised to the sky. The clouds parted
and a bright star appeared.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>She cried out with delight: “Oh, there you are!
I’ve been looking for you a long time. I was
afraid you had forgotten me. You need not blink
at me and twinkle so. I see you! I know you!
I promised to see you to-night, so I’ve come on
this hill to be near you. You know what I want.
Don’t go away and leave me! It’s so dark, it
frightens me. I’m coming to you! You are the
only friend I have.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c002'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>I’m coming! Pretty star, stay!</div>
      <div class='line'>I’m coming! Don’t, oh don’t go away.</div>
      <div class='line'>Don’t leave me alone, little star!</div>
      <div class='line'>For I am down here, and you are so far.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>

<p class='c005'>Other children had been put to bed hours before,
and told that angels would guard their beds
through the night. The little ones thought they
came down on ladders, from some place they were
taught to call heaven. Janet knew nothing of
warm beds, good food, or fine clothes—of heaven,
or of angels that came down on ladders.</p>

<p class='c005'>There was a rustling of the dried leaves on the
bank, near the water. Janet held her breath in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>fear, but the sound died away. Then she continued
to whisper to the star, “You have talked
to me so many nights, blinking at me through the
window. I’m coming!”</p>

<p class='c005'>The child of ignorance, poverty, and despair
stood on a stone to be nearer the star. The wind
had risen, and wrapped the girl’s black hair
around her like a mantle. Her arms were
stretched out to the star, and her eyes were fixed
with unutterable love on the shining orb. And
who shall say that there were no angels, waiting
for her to ascend on high?</p>

<p class='c005'>Silently the child stood there, with clasped hands
and wide, staring eyes, until the star went out, as
she thought. Then she looked down into the
water, and saw the star there, for the clouds had
parted once more, and it seemed nearer to her
than it did up above.</p>

<hr class='c006' />

<p class='c005'>As the clouds rolled away, the silence of the
night was broken by crackling twigs and loosened
stones rolling down the steep side of the hill. A
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>splash in the water, which seemed to smile, as it
rippled in circle after circle, until it again settled
into stillness; and the star shone brilliantly as
ever, but told nothing of what it had seen.</p>

<hr class='c006' />

<p class='c005'>Standing on the avenue after midnight was a
watchful policeman. Out of the park came a
mongrel dog, which ran up to him and with
a piteous whine put his paws upon him and looked
up into his face.</p>

<p class='c005'>The policeman was a kindly man, and, taking
some food from his pocket, he offered it to the
dog, talking to him and patting him. But the dog
refused all kindness for himself. That was not
what he wanted. It seemed as if tears were almost
in his eyes, and he spoke as plainly as a dog could
speak, looking from the policeman over to the
great lonely park. The officer more than half
understood him, but he was not allowed to leave
his beat. The dog continued his pleading until he
saw that it was of no avail. He ran back into the
park and up the hill to the top, where on the walk
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>he sniffed around the Bishop’s stockings that lay
where Janet had dropped them. Then, with a
piteous cry, he sprang down the steep side of the
hill, and the water once more seemed to smile as
it gently rippled to the bank.</p>

<p>Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the

<h3>Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works</h3>

<p>1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.</p>

<p>1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.</p>

<p>1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.</p>

<p>1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work

performed, viewed, copied or distributed:</p>

<blockquote><p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United
  States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost
  no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use
  it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with
  this eBook or online
  at <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
  are not located in the United States, you'll have to check the laws
  of the country where you are located before using this
  ebook.</p></blockquote>

<p>1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.</p>

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official

Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that</p>

<ul>
<li>You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.</li>

<li>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.</li>

<li>You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>
</ul>

<p>1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</p>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.</p>

<p>1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

<p>1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

<p>1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.</p>

<p>1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.  </p>

<h3>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3>Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.</p>

<p>The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
